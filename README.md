## Installation 
The current build can be found in the Tutorials folder. Place [FastFluidSolverMT.dll](https://github.com/christophwaibel/GH_Wind/tree/master/Tutorials/FastFluidSolverMT.dll) and [GHWind.gha](https://github.com/christophwaibel/GH_Wind/tree/master/Tutorials/GHWind.gha) into your Rhino Grasshopper components folder and you are good to go.

## Examples
Try out the `*.gh` and `*.3dm` files in the [Tutorials](https://github.com/christophwaibel/GH_Wind/tree/master/Tutorials) folder as examples. The folder also contains two optimization examples (`200528_Highrise.gh`and `200528_Breathability.gh`).
